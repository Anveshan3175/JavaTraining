> Java is
    programming language
    platform

> Just like class stores its state in fields, a method stores its state in local variables. Prameters are not fields

> Java classes in general are not applications. They don't have main methods. Java classes are meant to be instantiated in other classes.

> Java is statically-typed , means all variables must be declared before they can be used.

> Interface is means for class to interact with outside world. They constitute methods.

    8-bit signed 2's complement integer.
    values range from -128 to 127 
    Saves memory in large arrays
    serves as documentation
> 2's complement representation
    to get 2’s complement of binary number calculate  1’s complement of given number plus 1
    To get 2's complement of 10010 - 01101(1's complement or invert each integer) + 1
    
    > 2’s Complementation in Signed Binary number Representation
      Positive numbers - keep binary representation as it is  [[ +5 = 0101]]
      Negative numbers - get 2's complement of binary  [[ -5 = 1011]]
      As you can see , MSB is always 1 in case of negative numbers.
