-> Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. 
  If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods . Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide.
  
-> objects define their interaction with the outside world through the methods that they expose. Methods form the object's 
	interface with the outside world
	
-> An object has data. It is the one that constitues state.Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly 
	exposed methods is known as data encapsulation. objects store their state in fields =>  individual states in "non-static fields"
	
-> A blueprint for a software object is called a class.

-> A collection of methods with no implementation is called an interface.

-> A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package.

-> expressions =>  compute values

Questions
1. What do you understand by Encapsulation ?
	An object has data. It is the one that constitues state.Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly 
	exposed methods is known as data encapsulation. objects store their state in fields =>  individual states in "non-static fields"
	
	- Exp candidate : Does static variable in class violate the Encapsulation ?
	  - Existence of static varibale  itself is a non-OOps concept. So there is no violation of Encapsulation - but a complete lack of object orientation.
	  - static methods and variables are against the OOP principles

2. What are static variables ? (2 - 4)
	In Java, a Static variable or a Class variable is a variable where all the instances of the class share the same value. It's value does not change for 
	each instance of the class. Hence, it is called Static variable. 
	
	-> Lifetime of static variable 	(4 - 6 - 8 - 10)
	The static variable is initialized when the class is loaded in memory and the variable can be accessed until the class is unloaded from 
	the memory or if the program execution completes. This is the lifetime of the static variable.
	
	-> What is the difference between normal variable and static variable? (2 - 4)
	The main difference is,  static variable is initiatlized only once  in a program and retains its value whereas normal value
	initialized everytime object is created 
	
3. What are instance variables, class variables, Local variables and parameters in java ? what are fields vs variables ? (2)
	-> variables inside class without static keyword - store state of class - Instance variables
	-> variables inside class with static keyword - class varaibles
	-> variables inside method - store state of method - local variables
	-> variables in method definition - parameters - They are not fields but only variables

4. What are primitive data types in java ?
	-> What is size of byte ? (8 bit signed 2's complement, -128 to 127 , save memory)
		-> unsigned holds only positive values and Signed variable holds both positive and negative values => byte holds both positive and negative values
		-> 2's complement is most common binary representation of signed numbers => 1's complement + 1(to LSB)
		
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	
Byte stores numbers in 2's complement. 
-> Positive decimal to 2's complement 
   -> Get binary of positive number
   -> Take 1's complement of binary (invert the numbers)
   -> Add one to the result
   8 -> 1000 -> 0111 -> (0111 + 1) -> 1000
Q) Interpret 11011011 as a two's complement binary number, and give its decimal equivalent.
	-> First, note that the number is negative, since it starts with a 1.
	-> Change the sign to get the magnitude of the number.
		1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1
	-	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
	+								1
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1
	-> Convert the magnitude to decimal: 001001012 = 2516 = 2Ã—16 + 5 = 3710.
	-> Since the original number was negative, the final result is -37.
