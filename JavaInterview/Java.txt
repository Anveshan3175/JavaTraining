-> Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. 
  If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods . Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide.
  
-> objects define their interaction with the outside world through the methods that they expose. Methods form the object's 
	interface with the outside world
	
-> An object has data. It is the one that constitues state.Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly 
	exposed methods is known as data encapsulation. objects store their state in fields =>  individual states in "non-static fields"
	
-> A blueprint for a software object is called a class.

-> A collection of methods with no implementation is called an interface.

-> A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package.

-> expressions =>  compute values

Questions
1. What do you understand by Encapsulation ?
	An object has data. It is the one that constitues state.Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly 
	exposed methods is known as data encapsulation. objects store their state in fields =>  individual states in "non-static fields"
	
	- Exp candidate : Does static variable in class violate the Encapsulation ?
	  - Existence of static varibale  itself is a non-OOps concept. So there is no violation of Encapsulation - but a complete lack of object orientation.
	  - static methods and variables are against the OOP principles

2. What are static variables ? (2 - 4)
	In Java, a Static variable or a Class variable is a variable where all the instances of the class share the same value. It's value does not change for 
	each instance of the class. Hence, it is called Static variable. 
	
	-> Lifetime of static variable 	(4 - 6 - 8 - 10)
	The static variable is initialized when the class is loaded in memory and the variable can be accessed until the class is unloaded from 
	the memory or if the program execution completes. This is the lifetime of the static variable.
	
	-> What is the difference between normal variable and static variable? (2 - 4)
	The main difference is,  static variable is initiatlized only once  in a program and retains its value whereas normal value
	initialized everytime object is created 
	
3. What are instance variables, class variables, Local variables and parameters in java ? what are fields vs variables ? (2)
	-> variables inside class without static keyword - store state of class - Instance variables
	-> variables inside class with static keyword - class varaibles
	-> variables inside method - store state of method - local variables
	-> variables in method definition - parameters - They are not fields but only variables

4. What are primitive data types in java ?
	-> What is size of byte ? (8 bit signed 2's complement, -128 to 127 , save memory)
		-> unsigned holds only positive values and Signed variable holds both positive and negative values => byte holds both positive and negative values

Since Byte stores numbers in 2's complement, below section detals the 2'complement concept.
-> 2's complement is most common binary representation of SIGNED numbers => 1's complement + 1(to LSB)
   -   TO store negative and positive numners in binary, 2's complement representation is preferred.
   -   MSB ----1 1 0 0 1 1 1---LSB
   -   Now, if they say that given binary number is 2's complement and you see '1' in MSB, then it is negative number. If you see '0' in MSB, then it is 
       positive number

-> Convert Decimal to 2's complement :
    - First, you convert the magnitude of the number to binary, 
    - pad to the word size (8 bits). (ensure number of binary digits are 8 by adding 0 to MSBs if they are less than 8)
    - If the original number was positive, you are done. 
    - Otherwise, you must negate the binary number by inverting the bits and adding 1.
    
    Ex 1: Convert -72 to an 8-bit, twos complement binary number.
    - Convert the magnitude, 72 to binary. The easiest way is to convert it to hex first. 72รท16 = 4 remainder 8, so 7210 = 4816 = 1001000.
    - Pad to 8 bits: 01001000  (1001000 padded to 01001000)
    - Since given number is -ve, Negate the number by inverting the bits and adding 1.
		0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
	-	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1  (invert)
	+								1  (Add 1)
	------------------------------------------------------------------
		1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0
	So, -72 is 10111000 as an eight-bit, two's complement number.

    Ex 2: Convert 47 to an 8-bit, twos complement binary number.
    - This is positive, so all that is needed is to convert to binary . 47รท16 = 2 remainder 15, so 4710 = 2f16 = 101111.
    - Pad to eight bits  (101111 padded to 00101111)
    - Since given number is +Ve,  47 as an 8-bit two's complement number is just 00101111.
 ----
 -> Convert 2's complement to Decimal
    - First check if the number is negative or positive by looking at the sign bit. 
    - If it is positive, simply convert it to decimal. 
    - If it is negative, make it positive by inverting the bits and adding one.
    - Then, convert the result to decimal. 
    - The negative of this number is the value of the original binary.

       Ex 1: Interpret 11011011 as a two's complement binary number, and give its decimal equivalent.
	- First, note that the number is negative, since it starts with a 1.
	- Change the sign to get the magnitude of the number.
			1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1
		-	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0 (invert)
		+								1
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
			0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1
	- Convert the magnitude to decimal: 00100101 = 37.
	- Since the original number was negative, the final result is -37.
	
	Ex 2: Interpret 01101001 as a two's complement binary number, and give its decimal equivalent. 
	 - The number is positive, so simply convert it to decimal: 01101001 = 105.


NOTE 1:  Convert binary to 2's complement form and 1's complement
NOTE 2:  Convert decimal to 2's complement form and 1's complement 
NOTE 3:  For 2's complement of POSITIVE DECIMAL, it is just binary conversion , for NEGATIVE DECIMAL invert + add1
